# Cashfree Webhook Configuration Guide

## Overview
This guide shows you how to configure the Cashfree payment webhook in your dashboard to automatically credit coins when users purchase coin packages.

## üîß Cashfree Dashboard Configuration

### Step 1: Access Webhook Settings
1. Login to your [Cashfree Dashboard](https://merchant.cashfree.com/)
2. Navigate to **"Developers"** ‚Üí **"Webhooks"**
3. Click **"Add Webhook"** or **"Configure Webhook"**

### Step 2: Webhook URL Configuration
Set your webhook URL based on your deployment:

**For Production:**
```
https://your-domain.com/api/v1/app/payment/webhook
```

**For Development/Testing:**
```
https://your-replit-url.replit.app/api/v1/app/payment/webhook
```

**For Local Testing (using ngrok):**
```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/v1/app/payment/webhook
```

### Step 3: Webhook Events
Select the following events to receive notifications:

‚úÖ **PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK** - Most important for coin crediting
‚úÖ **PAYMENT_FAILED_WEBHOOK** - Optional for analytics
‚úÖ **PAYMENT_USER_DROPPED_WEBHOOK** - Optional for analytics

### Step 4: Webhook Security (Recommended)
1. Enable **Webhook Signature Verification**
2. Copy the **Webhook Secret Key**
3. Add it to your environment variables as `CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## üìù Webhook Payload Structure

When a payment succeeds, Cashfree sends this payload to your webhook:

```json
{
  "type": "PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK",
  "data": {
    "order": {
      "order_id": "CF_ORDER_1754548025000_123",
      "order_amount": 10.00,
      "order_currency": "INR",
      "payment_id": "12345_67890",
      "payment_status": "PAID",
      "payment_amount": 10.00,
      "payment_currency": "INR",
      "payment_message": "Transaction Successful",
      "payment_time": "2025-01-07T06:35:00+05:30"
    },
    "customer_details": {
      "customer_name": "John Doe",
      "customer_email": "john@example.com",
      "customer_phone": "+917696457890"
    }
  }
}
```

## ü§ñ Automatic Processing Flow

Here's what happens when your webhook receives a payment notification:

### 1. Webhook Receives Notification
```javascript
app.post("/api/v1/app/payment/webhook", async (req, res) => {
  const { type, data } = req.body;
  
  if (type === "PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK" && data.order.payment_status === "PAID") {
    // Process successful payment
  }
});
```

### 2. Find Pending Transaction
```javascript
const pendingTransaction = allTransactions.find(t => 
  t.transactionId === order_id && t.status === "pending"
);
```

### 3. Credit Coins to User
```javascript
// Update wallet balance
await storage.updateWalletBalance(
  pendingTransaction.userId, 
  wallet.coinBalance + pendingTransaction.amount  // Add purchased coins
);

// Mark transaction as completed
await storage.updateWalletTransaction(pendingTransaction.id, {
  status: "completed",
  transactionId: `${order_id}_${payment_id}`
});
```

### 4. Sync to Firebase
```javascript
// Update Firebase for real-time mobile app sync
await FirestoreService.updateUserWallet(userId, {
  userId: pendingTransaction.userId,
  coinBalance: updatedWallet.coinBalance,
  totalEarned: updatedWallet.totalEarned,
  totalSpent: updatedWallet.totalSpent
});

// Store transaction in Firebase
await FirestoreService.storeWalletTransaction({
  userId: userId.toString(),
  amount: pendingTransaction.amount,
  type: "credit",
  description: "Coin Package Purchase",
  transactionId: `${order_id}_${payment_id}`,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

## üß™ Testing the Webhook

### Method 1: Manual Webhook Test
Use curl to simulate a Cashfree webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/v1/app/payment/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK",
    "data": {
      "order": {
        "order_id": "CF_ORDER_TEST_123",
        "payment_id": "PAY_TEST_456",
        "payment_status": "PAID"
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Method 2: Cashfree Dashboard Test
1. Go to **"Developers"** ‚Üí **"Webhooks"** in Cashfree dashboard
2. Click **"Test Webhook"**
3. Select **"PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK"**
4. Send test payload to your webhook URL

### Method 3: Live Payment Test
1. Create a small test coin package (‚Çπ1 for 10 coins)
2. Make an actual test payment
3. Verify coins are automatically credited
4. Check webhook logs in your server console

## üîç Webhook Response Codes

Your webhook should respond with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **200 OK**: Webhook processed successfully
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid payload format
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Processing failed (Cashfree will retry)

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### Server Logs
Monitor your server logs for webhook activity:
```bash
# Look for these log messages:
Cashfree webhook received: { type: 'PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK', data: ... }
Payment successful: PAY_123_456, coins credited to user 789
```

### Cashfree Dashboard
Check webhook delivery status in Cashfree dashboard:
- **"Developers"** ‚Üí **"Webhooks"** ‚Üí **"Logs"**
- View delivery attempts, response codes, and retry attempts

### Database Verification
Check your database for:
- Transaction status changed from "pending" to "completed"
- User wallet balance increased by purchased coin amount
- New transaction record with correct details

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Webhook not receiving notifications:**
- Check webhook URL is accessible from internet
- Verify URL is correctly configured in Cashfree dashboard
- Check server logs for incoming requests

**Coins not being credited:**
- Verify pending transaction exists with matching order ID
- Check wallet update logs
- Ensure Firebase sync is working

**Duplicate coin credits:**
- Implement idempotency checks using order ID
- Verify transaction status before processing

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Validate webhook signatures** (implement webhook secret verification)
2. **Check payment status** before crediting coins
3. **Prevent duplicate processing** using order IDs
4. **Log all webhook events** for audit trail
5. **Use HTTPS** for webhook URLs
6. **Implement rate limiting** on webhook endpoints
